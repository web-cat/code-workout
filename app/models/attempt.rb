# =============================================================================
# The Attempt class represents one attempt at answering one Exercise.
# The Attempt is associated with the specific version of the exercise that
# was answered.  If the exercise was part of a workout, then the Attempt is
# also associated with the WorkoutScore for that workout through workout_score.
# If the Attempt is the most recent attempt--that is, if it is the attempt
# counted in the overall score for the workout, as opposed to some earlier
# but now superceded attempt--then it is /also/ related to the WorkoutScore
# through the active_score relation.  For past attempts that are /not/ being
# counted as part of the workout's score, the active_score relation should
# be kept at nil.
#
# In other words, all of the attempts for one exercise in one workout
# should have a valid workout_score relation pointing to the same WorkoutScore
# object, but only one of them (the most recent) should have a non-nil
# active_score relation ... and that non-nil active_score should be the
# same as its workout_score relation.
